# Playground front end for apa project

## TODO
- [x] add resize to all sides
- [ ] cache responsive behavior
- [ ] title nav component - container flex fill inner space - 
- [ ] right click, ctrl zoom, green button, auto hide nav title


consideration: RGL overlap doesn't let you control z index. Quick fix- overlap=false 
OR
can you dynamically assign z index based on last click?
